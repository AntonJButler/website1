    <h2 class="center med">What was the Light Side of the force?</h2>

    <p>The light side of the Force, also known as Ashla, was one of two methods of using the Force.<br>
    The light side was aligned with calmness, peace, and passiveness, and was used only for knowledge and defense.
    The Jedi were notable practitioners of the light, being selfless servants of the will of the Force</p>

    <h3 class="center med">selflessness</h3>

    <p>The light side of the Force was selflessness. Its Jedi practitioners lived in the present, clearing their mind, letting go of their consciousness, and listening to the Force, acting on instinct.<br>
    The Jedi Order, which was devoted to the light side of the Force, had the core principle of being the guardians of peace and justice, which was exemplified by their altruism during the High Republic Era.<br>
    As decreed by the Jedi Code, Jedi were committed to compassionâ€”unconditional love for all living things. Compassionate actions extended to dying, as a member of the Jedi Order believed in loss in the service of a greater good.</p>
    
    <h4 class="center med">Balance of the Force</h4>
    
    <p>Balance in the Force/harmony between all life was achieved by mainting an understanding and accepting the dark side of the Force that exists within oneself.<br>
    Serving the light side of the Force; practitioners of this method, namely Jedi, devoted themselves to the will of the Force, acting in accordance to the symbiotic relationship between the Living Force and the Cosmic Force.<br>
    As well as the transformation/connections of the energy of all living things. Submitting to the Cosmic Force and what it communicated to them through the midi-chlorians.</p>
