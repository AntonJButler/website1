    <h2 class="center med">What was the Dark Side of the force?</h2>

    <p class="small">The dark side of the Force, also known as Bogan or the shadow, was one of two ways of channeling the Force. To tap into the power of the dark side was to indulge in raw emotions such as passion, anger, and hatred.<br>
    The dark side was greed, the fear of change, and the inability to let go. By holding on to things, one became angry and hateful, which in turn led to suffering.<br>
    Those who were unable to conquer their dark side were devoured by it. The Sith were Force-sensitives well known for serving the will of the dark side and being the mortal enemies of the Jedi, who served the will of the light side of the Force.</p>
    
    <h3 class="center med">Hubis</h3>

    <p class="small">The dark side was selfishness, fear, and aggressive feelings in all living things.<br>
    However, beings were often tempted to deny and try to escape from this truth, imagining the dark side to be something external, something that is not the part of them, something that they can rid themselves of.<br>
    Such hubris was easy to fall intoâ€”even Grand Master Yoda, who trained to conquer his darkness for hundreds of years, initially refused to recognize his own dark reflection. However, in denying this truth he only fed the dark side. </p>

    <h4 class="center med">Greed of Power</h4>

    <p class="small">The dark side was seductive and considered "quick and easy path" among the Jedi.<br>
    Most Sith were known too be devotees seeking power, at any cost. Resorting to using ways to harness more power through hate, decepetion & ambition as fuel.<br>
    There were some dark side users who used it for beneolent motives, not just seflishness & greed but ultimately would become victims to the dark side</p>
